    What's new in Carebearium

%h3#news-13082015 13.08.2015 - (My interest in) EvE is dead, the same as the current status of this project.
%p
  If I come back to the game, some development might happen. No promises. The servers will stay on as long as Heroku doesn't start sending bigger bills. Source code is available at
  %a{ href: 'https://bitbucket.org/tmikoss/carebearium', target: '_blank' }

%p
  There has not been a meaningful Carebearium update for nearly a month now, so here's the lowdown of what's happening:
%ul
  %li
    In broad strokes, the next planned features: solar system detailed view, neighbouring system details and (limited) historical view.
  %li
    I'm preparing to move the site from Heroku to a dedicated server - the current plus planned features have outgrown what Heroku supports at reasonable price point.
  %li
    Some university projects are due early december, so I'm prioritising that. Oh, and work.
  %li
    The above means the next meaningful new features will coincide with my next batch of free-ish time: christmas.
%p
  %strong
    The takeaway:
%ol
  %li
    development has slowed down, but by no means dead;
  %li
    you have couple weeks to vote on the new features that interest you, click that 'Suggestions' button below.

    button, and it will select only the solar systems that DON'T match the specified criteria. For example, you can now find
    %a{ ng-click: "filterWithPreset([{ kind: 'station_count', min: 1 }, { kind: 'station_service', choice: 'cloning', reversed: true }], ['name', 'asc'])" }
      system with a station, but without a cloning service.
